The access.yaml file should be readable
by the broker but not by the web application
because it contains an FTP password per site.

The site name as used in the title of each section need
not be the same as the address so you could provide
different sections with different content referring to
the same site (e.g. different FTP accounts).

Protocol is included because this may be extended beyond
the first protocol being used which is FTP.
