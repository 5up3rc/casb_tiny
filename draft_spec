A cheap web hosting service holds files that can
be updated using FTP with user/pass.  To share the
service with multiple people you do not want them
knowing the password.  You also want them to keep
to some policy you can define.  A broker could meet
these requirements.

1. authenticate user identity and bind to a session

2. record upload and similar activity in the CASB

3. flexible policy to allow
   - uploads only (no delete/modify)
   - access only under certain parts of the doc tree
   - constrain depth of subdirectories
   - modify/delete files change by same person
   - check file name properties
   - check file content properties
   - account and policy expiry

4. as permitted by policy copy changes from the session
   to the web
   - FTP user/pass for basic web hosting
   - local copy for a VPS

5. logging

6. optional triggers:
   - recreate HTML indexing data files
   - optional tagging on web (marking newest content)
   - new backup
   - email from broker to user when action performed

    Visibility
    Data security
    Compliance
    Threat Prevention
