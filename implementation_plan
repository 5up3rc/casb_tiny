1. authenticate user identity and bind to a session
   see perl dancer upload -  https://perlmaven.com/uploading-files-with-dancer2
   want TLS (provided by OpenBSD httpd)
   cater for Openid
      https://metacpan.org/search?q=openid
      (https://metacpan.org/search?q=oauth is authz not authn)

2. record upload and similar activity in the CASB
   write to spool directory - mostly done

3. flexible policy to allow
   user/role/host definitions in YAML files

4. as permitted by policy deploy changes
   perl module for FTP (several available)

5. logging
   files or syslog?

6. optional triggers:
   plugin library and event category

--------
Gartner has defined the four pillars of CASB as:
    Visibility
    Data security
    Compliance
    Threat Prevention
Can I explain how this tool meets those "pillars"?
